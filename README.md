# 📚 Integrated Library System (ILS)  

### 🚀 About the Project  

This project is an **Integrated Library System (ILS)** built from scratch for a **school with 700 students** and a collection of **1800 to 2000 books**. The goal is to provide a **fully controlled, scalable, and efficient** digital library management system that helps students and administrators track books, manage borrowing and returns, and streamline library operations.  

We are building this system with **full control over the development process**, ensuring flexibility in features, security, and future scalability.  

### 🏗️ Features  

✅ **Student Registration & Management** – Allows students to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.  
✅ **Book Catalog** – A searchable catalog to browse and filter books based on author, title, genre, and availability.  
✅ **Borrow & Return System** – Track borrowed books, due dates, and returns efficiently.  
✅ **Admin Dashboard** – Manage books, track loans, and oversee student activity.  
✅ **Azure Cloud Integration** – Secure storage of data using **Azure SQL Database** and authentication with **Azure Active Directory**.  
✅ **Scalability & Security** – Designed to scale for larger schools and ensure student data security.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, or React (to be decided based on performance and UI requirements).  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django (final decision pending).  
- **Database:** Azure SQL Database for structured data storage.  
- **Authentication:** Azure Active Directory for secure login and access control.  
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Microsoft Azure**, leveraging cloud infrastructure for reliability and performance.  

### 📌 Why Are We Building This?  

Many school libraries still rely on manual or outdated systems for managing books and student records. By creating a **custom, cloud-integrated, and scalable** solution, we aim to:  

- **Improve Efficiency** – Reduce manual work for librarians and students.  
- **Enhance Accessibility** – Allow students to check book availability online anytime.  
- **Ensure Security** – Protect student and book records using **cloud-based authentication**.  
- **Enable Full Control** – Unlike off-the-shelf solutions, this project gives us complete control over features, UI, and backend logic.  

### 🔧 Development Roadmap  

1️⃣ **Project Planning & Database Design** – Structuring the database and planning the system architecture.  
2️⃣ **Frontend Development** – Building UI components for the book catalog, borrowing system, and admin dashboard.  
3️⃣ **Backend API Implementation** – Creating a RESTful API to handle book management, user authentication, and borrowing logic.  
4️⃣ **Azure Integration** – Setting up cloud database, authentication, and hosting.  
5️⃣ **Testing & Deployment** – Conducting thorough testing before deploying the system on Azure.
